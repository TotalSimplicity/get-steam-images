## SteamGrid Art Puller
A simple python script to search for a game and pull the grid, icon, logo, and hero into a directory to easily add art for a non-steam game, or whatever else you need.

### Usage:
Create a .env file in the same directory as the fetchgame.py script.
```
STEAMGRID_APIKEY=your-api-key-here
```
Your api key can be found [here](https://www.steamgriddb.com/profile/preferences/api)

Then, just run python fetchgame.py follow the instructions.
Game art will be put into the same directory as the script.
